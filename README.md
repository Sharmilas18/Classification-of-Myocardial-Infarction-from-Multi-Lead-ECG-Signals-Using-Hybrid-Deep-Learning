**ABSTRACT:**

Myocardial Infarction, commonly known as heart 
attack is a serious condition that causes severe damage to the 
myocardium. Majority of the researches were engaged in 
preprocessing the ECG signals. This involved various steps such 
as reducing the noise, removing trends, segmenting beats and 
selecting relevant features before building models and 
classifying the data using machine learning methods. In this 
paper, the proposed model is an ensemble of 12 experts with 
predefined CNN architectures like AlexNet and GoogLeNet 
using the ECG signals without any complex preprocessing. 
Hyper parameters are tuned to give an accuracy of 98.78%, 
further tested with 6 datasets apart from the PTB database 
which gives an accuracy of an average of 75%. The model is 
significant compared with two other methods such as 12 lead 
scalogram collage method with an accuracy of 20.18% and 
concatenated raw signal method with an accuracy of 60.43%.
